An Indian passenger jet that encountered a hailstorm mid-flight and left passengers terrified, made a safe landing, despite significant damage to the plane.
The IndiGo plane was traveling from Indian capital New Delhi to Srinagar, the largest city in India-administered Kashmir on Wednesday – a flight that typically takes about an hour and a half – when it was met with “a sudden hailstorm en route,” according to a statement from IndiGo.
“The flight and cabin crew followed established protocol, and the aircraft landed safely in Srinagar,” it said.
The statement did not specify what damage the plane encountered but photographs of the aircraft show a large hole in the nose.
Delhi experienced widespread rain, lightning, and thunderstorms Wednesday night.
Video taken by a passenger, Sheikh Samiullah, and posted to X shows widespread panic and fear the moment the plane encountered the hail, causing severe turbulence that rattled the inside of the aircraft.
People can be heard screaming and children can be heard crying as the plane shakes violently.
The flight was going smoothly and passengers assumed they would arrive in Srinagar within 30 minutes when the pilot made a fasten seatbelt announcement, Samiullah told the Press Trust of India news agency.
“There was so much turbulence that I thought it was my last flight. Everyone thought we would crash. It was such a traumatic experience,” he said.
“I am a frequent flier, but I’ve never experienced anything like this. We are very thankful to the pilot for landing safely.”
