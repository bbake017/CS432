As tourist numbers continue to rise worldwide, African wildlife parks are facing unprecedented challenges. In Kenya's iconic Masai Mara Reserve, the home of the Great Migration and one of the natural wonders of the world, the number of wildebeest migrating has dropped as tourist numbers have gone up. We take a look at the delicate balancing act required to ensure the preservation of the migration with evergrowing travel demands. Also: ranked one of Africa's growing companies by the Financial Times in 2024, Hubtel originally began two decades ago as a messaging company in Ghana. Since then, it's turned into an e-payments and commerce behemoth with 23 offices across Ghana. We spoke to CEO Alex Bram about the company's pivot towards fintech, growth strategy, and the importance of staying purely self funded within Ghana.

Many people travel to Mongolia to disconnect, to escape into the vast wilderness and switch off. But for Mongolians, connectivity is everything. The country has 3.5 million people and 5 million active phone numbers. Everywhere you look in the capital city Ulaanbaatar, people are glued to their phones. A vibrant startup scene in the city is driving innovation and diversifying Mongolia's economy beyond its mining roots, fueled by a young, ambitious, and entrepreneurial population. A new digital infrastructure is not only reshaping how people travel, live and shop here - but tackling some of the country's biggest challenges: congestion, pollution and climate change. Innovations first cultivated in the city are taking root in remote corners of the country, where 30% of the population still live nomadic lifestyles. Forget Silicon Valley, this is the Silicon Steppe, where homegrown startups are powering Mongolia's digital transformation.

As tourist numbers continue to rise worldwide, African wildlife parks are facing unprecedented challenges. In Kenya's iconic Masai Mara Reserve, the home of the Great Migration and one of the natural wonders of the world, the number of wildebeest migrating has dropped as tourist numbers have gone up. We take a look at the delicate balancing act required to ensure the preservation of the migration with evergrowing travel demands. Also: ranked one of Africa's growing companies by the Financial Times in 2024, Hubtel originally began two decades ago as a messaging company in Ghana. Since then, it's turned into an e-payments and commerce behemoth with 23 offices across Ghana. We spoke to CEO Alex Bram about the company's pivot towards fintech, growth strategy, and the importance of staying purely self funded within Ghana.
