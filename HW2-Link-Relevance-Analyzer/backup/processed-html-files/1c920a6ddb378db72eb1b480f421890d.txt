The Pro Football Hall of Fame announced Wednesday the 128 candidates from the modern era who are eligible for induction as part of the 2026 class.
Thirteen-time Pro Bowler Drew Brees, 11-time Pro Bowler Larry Fitzgerald, three-time Pro Bowler Thomas Davis and two-time All-Pro LeSean McCoy are among the first-time nominees:

Offensive tackle Willie Anderson, wide receiver Torry Holt, linebacker Luke Kuechly and kicker Adam Vinatieri are all returning to the ballot. They have already advanced to the finalist stage as well after having narrowly missed the cut in 2025.
The HOF selection committee eventually settles on between three and five players for enshrinement from the modern era. The competition figures to be fierce because Brees and Fitzgerald could account for two of those spots.
Brees is one of the most prolific passers in NFL history. He ranks second in completions (7,142), yards (80,358) and touchdowns (571), and his 98.7 QB rating is seventh all time.
The New Orleans Saints legend is a lock for the Hall of Fame. The only question is whether he goes in on the first ballot.
It's the same story for Fitzgerald, whose longevity set him apart. He never once led the NFL in receiving yards but cracked the 1,000-yard at the age of 34.
The former Arizona Cardinals star trails only Jerry Rice in both catches (1,432) and yardage (17,492), and he's sixth in touchdown grabs (121).
