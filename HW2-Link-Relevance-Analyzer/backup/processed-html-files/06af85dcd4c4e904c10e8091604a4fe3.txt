President Donald Trump made good on his threat to double tariffs on imports from India to 50%, a move that could endanger relations with one of America’s most important trading partners and send consumer prices higher.
This comes just weeks after Trump instituted a new 25% baseline tariff on Indian goods. Levies on India, the world’s fifth-largest economy , are now among the highest the United States charges across all countries.
The latest round of tariffs on India seeks to punish the country for importing Russian oil and helping Russia finance its war with Ukraine, Trump has previously said.
The US leader recently held separate meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to help broker a deal to end their years-long war. However, the talks remain at an impasse.
American firms and, more recently, consumers, are already seeing higher costs resulting from Trump’s tariff campaign while the health of the labor market has deteriorated . The ramped-up levies on Indian goods could worsen both effects.
New Delhi signaled it would retaliate against Trump’s tariffs earlier this month, when Trump initially vowed to impose what he referred to as “secondary sanctions.”
India’s junior foreign minister, Kirti Vardhan Singh, told reporters Wednesday the government is “taking appropriate steps so that it does not harm our economy and let me assure you that the strength of our economy will carry us through these times.”
“Our concern is our energy security, and we will continue to purchase energy sources from whichever country benefits us,” he said.
