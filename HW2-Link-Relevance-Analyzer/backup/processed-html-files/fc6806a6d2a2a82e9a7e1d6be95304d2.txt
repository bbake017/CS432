Vox Entertainment will produce a new CNN original series, the network announced in a press release Wednesday. The working title for the series is “American Style.”
“‘American Style’ is a four-part CNN Original Series, produced by Vox Entertainment – the original programming division of Vox Media – that examines how America’s changing style through the decades has mirrored the political, social, and economic climate of the time, shaping our unique American identity,” said CNN.
“Using archival footage and interviews with fashion experts and cultural figures, American Style will highlight the most iconic moments from fashion, history, and pop culture, giving audiences a front row seat to the runway of American history.”
The partnership is a win for Vox Media, which has been hit by staff layoffs and a successful unionization effort in recent months.
The “American Style” series was one of six new original productions announced by CNN. The others include “Chasing Life with Sanjay Gupta,” “Tricky Dick,” “American Dynasties: The Bushes,” “Once in a Great City: Detroit 1962-64” and “The Redemption Project”
The new line up of shows for 2018/2019 will also see many of the familiar faces return including Anthony Bourdain and his “Parts Unknown” and W. Kamau Bell’s “United Shades of America.”
