Abu Dhabi-based photographer Hussain AlMoosawi is documenting the architecture of the United Arab Emirates to understand its rapidly evolving urban landscape. Born in 1984, he found himself drawn to early modern architecture, like the Obeid Al Mazrouei building in Abu Dhabi (pictured). Also known as the “Connect Four” building, this 10-story residential building from the 1980s has a striking facade of circle frames, offering shade and privacy to the terraces behind. Look through the gallery to see more distinctive architecture from Abu Dhabi and the Emirates.

AlOmaira Building, Abu Dhabi: This vivid green 14-story residential building is located in the city’s historic Al Zahiyah area. While many of the neighborhood’s older buildings, dating back to the 1960s, have been demolished, the distinctive AlOmaira Building, built sometime in the 1980s, is still standing.

429 Airport Road, Abu Dhabi: Airport Road, now renamed Sheikh Rashid Bin Saeed Street, is a busy traffic artery, connecting the city’s waterfront Corniche Street to the airport. Many of its buildings date back to the 1970s and ‘80s: AlMoosawi doesn’t know when this apartment block was built, but hopes to eventually crowd source historical information on different locations.

512 Airport Road features distinctive arches above its windows. AlMoosawi says the top of many facades from the 80s reflected some facet of Islamic architecture, to conform with the country’s building codes.

511 Airport Road, Abu Dhabi: This photo shows the Abdulla Majid AlMuhairy building, which was repainted — although according to AlMoosawi , the new color “still beautifully empowered the design forms.” While documenting this modern heritage, AlMoosawi has started to observe patterns in the facades, which he says is a distinctive Emirati  aesthetic. He plans to create an archive, to further develop and analyze the style.

Al-Ibrahimi Building, Abu Dhabi: AlMoosawi describes the the 16-story cylindrical Al-Ibrahimi Building as "eye-poppingly attractive." Built in the 1980s it features "balconies inside interlocking cubes that look like white ribbon."

AlKetbi Building, Abu Dhabi: Built in the 1980s or 90s and "inspired by the geometrical structure of beehives and their honeycombs," AlKetbi Building, on Muroor Road, "maintains a sense of warmth and charm found in earlier buildings, despite a strong and sleek expression of glass and new materials," according to AlMoosawi.

AlBahr Towers, Abu Dhabi: Not all the buildings that AlMoosawi photographs are old. The twin AlBahr towers in Abu Dhabi were completed in 2012, but their responsive facade puts a contemporary spin on the traditional shading method of mashrabiya with an abstract, triangular pattern. AlMoosawi points to its “traditional” ochre hues, which he says is rarely seen in buildings after the 1980s, as a call back to the city’s mid-century architecture.

AlJazeera Tower, Abu Dhabi: Another contemporary building, the Al Jazeera Tower, was commissioned in 2010 and completed in 2016. The diamond pattern on its facade echoes the geometric shapes of older buildings.

Liwa Tower, Abu Dhabi: The bright orange exterior of Liwa Tower is hard to miss. Completed in 2014, the 20-story steel structure took five years to build. The symmetrical design of abstract, imperfect ovals was one of AlMoosawi’s first images in the project.

King Faisal Street, Sharjah: While King Faisal Street, in Sharjah, might be better known for its mosque, one of the largest in the UAE, it's this residential block that captured AlMoosawi’s attention.

Deira Tower, Dubai: Built in 1979 and opened a year later, Deira Tower exemplifies many aspects of the UAE’s early modernist structures: its abstract geometries include curved concrete facades adorned with Arabic-style arches.

Toyota Building, Dubai: The Nasser Rashid Lootah Building, commonly known as the Toyota Building because of the neon Toyota advertisement that was on its roof, is a residential block in Dubai built in the 1970s.

Dubai World Trade Centre: Designed by John Harris, the British architect who also created Dubai’s master plan, the 39-story Dubai World Trade Centre became the city’s first iconic skyscraper in 1979. Its facade, with recessed balconies and symmetrical arches, blends Islamic and modernist architectural styles.

Why this Abu Dhabi photographer is ‘reimagining the city as if it were in the 1980s’

CNN —
When Hussain AlMoosawi arrived home, he didn’t recognize anything.
The Emirati photographer, who had spent eight years studying in Australia, returned to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in 2013. He’d missed a real estate boom of dizzying proportions: not just new buildings, but new districts.
More than that, the buildings of his childhood were disappearing, replaced by shiny new skyscrapers.
But for AlMoosawi, these international icons were not the urban fabric of his home: it was the oft-overlooked, mid-century office towers and residential blocks squeezed between new highways and overshadowed by luxury developments that felt most familiar.
It sparked a desire to “understand the urban context of the UAE,” and AlMoosawi set out to meticulously document and capture these underappreciated buildings, “and reimagine the city as if it were the ‘80s, the time when I was born.”
Initially focusing on industrial landscapes, temporary structures and air conditioning units, he began to notice symmetry in many of the buildings he was photographing, inspiring his current project: facades.
“Facades are like a face,” said AlMoosawi. “It’s something that people connect with.”
His bold, geometric images strip away context to spotlight the character and diversity of everyday buildings. Using a telephoto lens to shoot close-ups from the ground or elevated positions, AlMoosawi carefully frames out distractions and sometimes removes minor obstructions like lampposts in post-processing.
So far, the 41-year-old, who is editor-in-chief for National Geographic AlArabiya Magazine, has photographed over 600 building﻿s across the UAE, and next year hopes to complete his collection in Abu Dhabi, where he lives.
In the long term, he hopes to turn the “lifetime project” into an interactive archive that both preserves urban heritage and invites viewers to rediscover their own city.
“Our cities aren’t big, in terms of scale, compared to many other cities,” said AlMoosawi. “But then they have a story to tell, they have things between the lines that we don’t see, and my quest is to see these things.”
A ‘hybrid’ design history
The AlOmaira Building, built in the 1980s, has a minimalist, modern facade that hides sunken windows between protruding rectangles to provide privacy and shade.

Born in 1984, AlMoosawi grew up during a period of rapid development: the UAE was formed a little over a decade earlier, and the discovery of oil in 1958 had led to significant urban expansion and an influx of foreign workers.
While many early buildings were designed by Western architects, the 1970s and ‘80s saw more Middle Eastern and South Asian architects moving to the UAE, particularly from Egypt and India, said George Katodrytis, a professor of architecture at the American University of Sharjah, who has lived in the UAE for 25 years. This multicultural history is reflected in its architectural identity, “which is different than the West and is not completely Islamic, in its patterns and formal language,” he added.
Buildings from the early days of the UAE fused modernist forms — like precast concrete facades — with climate adaptations, social customs, and Arabian and Islamic design features like arches and domes, creating a “hybrid” identity, said Katodrytis.
Katodrytis sees a distinctive style emerging in Emirati facades of the 1970s and ‘80s, with features like recessed balconies creating a “jigsaw puzzle” effect that reflects cultural preferences for privacy and heavily shaded outdoor space.
“It’s not what we expect Islamic architecture to be, from a textbook or history, but it’s more of an informal interpretation,” said Katodrytis.
The twin AlBahr towers in Abu Dhabi, completed in 2012, put a contemporary spin on the traditional shading methods of mashrabiya. AlMoosawi points to its “traditional” ochre hues, which he says are rarely seen in buildings after the 1980s, as a call back to the city’s mid-century architecture.

Like the rest of the UAE, Abu Dhabi has continued to expand over the past few decades. Between 1975 and 2019, its urban area grew from just 54 square kilometers to 758 square kilometers, and according to government data , the city saw a 66% increase in the number of residential and non-residential units between 2011 and 2023. In recent years, “mega projects” such as Yas Island and Saadiyat Island have added new residential and business hubs to the ever-evolving city.
Construction methods, materials and styles have changed significantly in the past 30 years, but Katodrytis can see an “indirect” legacy in some of the city’s recent structures, which have some similarities to designs from the 1980s, rather than those from the 2000s: “The facades have more thickness, less glass, and it’s a little bit more three-dimensional.”
Projects like the Abrahamic Family House, an interfaith complex featuring a mosque, church, and synagogue, and Louvre Abu Dhabi, offer more subtle inflections of Arabian design, focusing more on the geometry and abstract shapes often seen in the city’s 20th-century architecture. The buildings also reflect the city’s distant past, when low-rise settlements centered around shared courtyards.

And while many buildings from the 20th century have been seen as outdated, and even demolished to make way for new construction, there’s been some changing sentiment around modern heritage.
At the 2014 Venice Biennale, the UAE’s exhibition highlighted 1970s-1980s residential architecture and its connection to the country’s cultural identity.
Since then, each Emirate has started to review its approach to urban conservation: in Abu Dhabi, 64 sites were given “unconditional protection” in 2023, including the Cultural Foundation, a 1980s building that was earmarked for demolition in 2010 before it was ultimately refurbished.
“The interesting thing is that (many of) these buildings are not necessarily big, iconic buildings. They’re middle class, even workers’ housing from the ‘60s and ‘70s. So it’s a different social, cultural value, which now has been elevated,” said Katodrytis.
In 2024, this was formalized in a national policy that focuses on identifying, documenting, and protecting modern architectural heritage in the UAE.
“In urban planning, if the value of the land supersedes the value of the building, then the building has no relevant value, and so it’s demolished to be replaced by another building,” said Katodrytis. “Now, the historic value of the building supersedes the economic value.”
A fresh perspective
Many of the buildings on Airport Road in Abu Dhabi date back to the 1970s and '80s, and feature Arabian arches and repeating, symmetrical geometries.

Other photographers have also been documenting the Emirates’ urban history: two European expatriates, known by their Instagram handle @abudhabistreets , are showcasing a side of the city beyond well-known landmarks, in a bid to reveal the cultural fabric and the city’s ever-evolving identity; and architecture professor and photographer Apostolos Kyriazis spent two years documenting Abu Dhabi’s public spaces for a joint research project.
For AlMoosawi, buildings from the ‘70s and ‘80s are deeply nostalgic, evoking memories of his grandmother’s low-rise home in Old Dubai, now a commercial center. The project has revealed to him “a clear architectural identity” that he’s found resonates with others, too.
His next challenge is working out how to organize and categorize the buildings. Finding information on buildings, like the architect or even the construction date, can be tricky, especially for older and less well-known residences, AlMoosawi said.
“I had the idea to put it out there as an interactive archive,” he said. “What I want is people to interact with these pictures. We have many people who lived in these buildings. They might have old pictures of them. So they could add more information, add more visual data, and you never know what you might get.”
By the end of the project, he expects to have photographed around 2,000 buildings — and hopes the project will inspire people to look again at the urban landscapes close to home that many of us take for granted.
“I have many people who tell me, ‘We’ve always lived here, we’ve never seen that,’” he added.
