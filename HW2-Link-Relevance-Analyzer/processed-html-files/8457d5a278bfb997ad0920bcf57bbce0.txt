Tucked away in a small, nondescript facility at Fort Knox lies a crucial operation in the US military supply chain — the AAFES Name Tape Plant. This factory manufactures nearly every name tag worn by service members across the US Armed Forces.
With just 17 employees, the plant produces up to 3,000 name tapes each day and as many as 60,000 a month for soldiers stationed around the world. Each tape passes through a meticulous manufacturing process that blends craftsmanship with industrial efficiency.
