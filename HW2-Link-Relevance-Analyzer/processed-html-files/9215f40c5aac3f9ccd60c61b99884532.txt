About us
Since 1821 the mission of the Guardian has been to use clarity and imagination to build hope.
Katharine Viner, editor-in-chief
Guardian Media Group is a global news organisation that delivers
fearless, investigative journalism - giving a voice to the powerless and holding power to account.
Our independent ownership structure means we are entirely free from political and commercial influence. Only our values determine the stories we choose to cover – relentlessly and courageously.
Our organisation
The Guardian’s agenda-setting journalism is underpinned by an independent ownership structure that is different from other global news organisations. It guarantees our journalism and our editor stay independent from any outside influence, whether financial, political or commercial.
In 1936, John Russell Scott — the proprietor of the Manchester Guardian, as it was then known — transferred his family’s stake in the newspaper to a group of trustees. The Scott Trust became the owner of the newspaper, putting in place the independent ownership structure that supports the Guardian to this day.
This independent ownership structure is made up of three key organisations:
The Scott Trust, the sole shareholder of Guardian Media Group. The purpose — and privilege — of the Trust is to secure the financial and editorial independence of the Guardian in perpetuity.
The Scott Trust Endowment, a fund built up following the prudent sale of assets with the core purpose of investing to provide financial returns to support Guardian journalism in perpetuity.
Guardian Media Group, the owner of Guardian News & Media (GNM) and publisher of the Guardian newspaper and website.
This exceptional, if not unique, form of governance for a news publisher ensures that all surplus financial returns are reinvested into our high quality journalism for a global audience rather than benefiting a proprietor or shareholders.
