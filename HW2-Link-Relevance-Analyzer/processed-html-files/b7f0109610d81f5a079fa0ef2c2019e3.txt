The 47th Flying Training Wing at Laughlin Air Force Base in Texas runs the Air Force's largest Specialized Undergraduate Pilot Training program.
The yearlong program trains new pilots for the US Air Force, Air Force Reserve, Air National Guard, and allied nations. After logging 50 to 60 hours in advanced flight simulators, students step inside the cockpit of a turboprop aircraft, where they learn to master basic aerobatics, navigation, and formation flying.
Those who graduate are assigned an aircraft and continue on to their next phase: aircraft-specific training at operational bases around the country.
