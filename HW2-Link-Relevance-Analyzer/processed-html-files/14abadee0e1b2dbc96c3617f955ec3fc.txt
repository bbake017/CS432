As ice caps in the arctic have melted and uncovered new shipping lanes and highly sought-after resources, the US Army has announced a new arctic strategy to establish a dominant presence and compete against countries like Russia and China. Key to this new strategy is the Army Mountain Warfare School in Jericho, Vermont, where soldiers are being trained in mountaineering, cold-weather skills, and high-elevation tactics.
Business Insider's senior producer Jake Gabbard spent 14 days inside the Army Mountain Warfare School, where service members train to fight, move, and survive in extreme cold temperatures and mountainous terrain. Fifty-one students begin the course, and only 40 will make it to graduation.
