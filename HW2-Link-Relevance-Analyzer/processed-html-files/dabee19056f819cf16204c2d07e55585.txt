Terms of Sale
Effective date: February 22, 2023.
These Terms of Sale govern the sale of the Subscription Products (as defined below) of Business Insider ("Business Insider"). By using the Subscription Products, you also agree to our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy .
1. Subscription Products
The Subscription Products include all or portions of the websites www.businessinsider.com , www.techinsider.io , www.insider.com , markets.businessinsider.com and their mobile sites, and tablet and mobile apps that are offered for a subscription fee. You are not necessarily required to purchase anything to use the Subscription Products. If you do not purchase a subscription, however, your access to the Subscription Products may be limited or restricted.
We reserve the right to modify the content, type and availability of any Subscription Product at any time. Additionally, we reserve the right to change or terminate any offered subscriptions or promotions at any time.
2. Subscription
a. Auto-renewing Subscription. Your Subscription Products, which may start with a discounted rate, will auto-renew at the end of the billing cycle stated at the time of your order ("Billing Period") at the then-current rate unless and until you cancel your subscription or it is terminated by Business Insider.
b. Differing Subscriptions/Promotions. We may offer various types of subscriptions, including subscriptions to different services and special promotions. Any materially different terms from those described in these Terms of Sale will be disclosed at the time of purchase or in other communications made available to you. You can find details regarding your subscription by visiting your account management page. We reserve the right to change or terminate any offered subscriptions or promotions at any time.
3. Billing
a. Payment Method. You can pay for your subscription with a major credit card ("Payment Method"). If your payment is unsuccessful by reason of insufficient funds, expiration, or otherwise, you remain responsible for any uncollected amount.
b. Recurring Billing. By placing an order for a Subscription Product, you authorize us to charge you the subscription fee then in effect at the beginning of each Billing Period to your Payment Method. For example, you authorize us to charge your Payment Method the promotional rate disclosed on the subscription screen in the initial Billing Period (if applicable) and the regular subscription rate in subsequent Bill Periods. We reserve the right to change the timing of our billing, in particular, in the event your Payment Method has not successfully settled. If your Payment Method is declined for a recurring payment of your subscription fee, provide us a new Payment Method promptly or your subscription will be canceled.
You acknowledge that the amount charged each Billing Period may vary for reasons that may include price changes or changing your subscription, and you authorize us to charge your Payment Method for such varying amounts each Billing Period.
c. Price Changes. We reserve the right to change subscription fees at any time. We will notify you of any changes if the regular fee for your subscription changes from what was stated at the time of your initial order. You will have an opportunity to cancel your subscription. If you do not cancel your subscription, you will be charged the new subscription fee at your next Billing Period.
d. Billing Period. We will charge the subscription fee at the commencement of your subscription, and then automatically at the start of each recurring Billing Period thereafter unless and until your subscription is canceled.
4. Cancellations and Refunds
a. Cancellations. You can cancel your subscription at any time by going to your account management page. You must cancel your subscription before it renews each Billing Period to avoid billing of the next Billing Period's subscription fees to your Payment Method. Accordingly, when you cancel, you cancel only future charges associated with your subscription, and you will not receive a refund for the current Billing Period. Your cancellation will become effective at the end of your current Billing Period, and you will continue to have access to your subscription for the balance of the Billing Period.
b. Refunds. Payments are non-refundable, and there are no refunds or credits for partially used Billing Periods.
5. E-Sign Disclosure and Consent.
By purchasing a Subscription Product and/or clicking on the box at account opening, you consent to receive notices, disclosures, agreements, policies, receipts, confirmations, transaction information, account information, other communications, and changes or updates to any such documents electronically (collectively, the "Electronic Messages"). You agree that the Electronic Messages will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that such communications be in writing.
6. Changes to the Terms of Sale.
We may, from time to time, change these Terms of Sale. When such changes are made, we will make a copy of the new Terms of Sale available to you on our website.
