Donald Trump feels threatened, all the time. “I think everything’s a threat,” he said at the Economic Club of Chicago recently. “There’s nothing that’s not a threat.”He’s threatened by “woke” businesses.He’s threatened by global trade and diplomacy.
He’s threatened by an independent Federal Reserve.He’s threatened by China (but not Russia).He’s threatened by voting and voters.He’s threatened by immigrants, undocumented workers and people of color.He’s threatened by women, reproductive rights and Kamala Harris.He’s threatened by law enforcement, schools, the media, the government, big cities, big tech, facts, civility, germs, the weather, sharks and windmills.Unlike the rest of us, Trump has myriad tools at his disposal to help conquer his fears — particularly if he revisits the Oval Office.
