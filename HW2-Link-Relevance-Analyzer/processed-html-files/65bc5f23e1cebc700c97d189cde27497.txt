Three times over the last 20 years, voters in Austin have been asked about building out a light rail system. The Texas capital has been the fastest growing metro area in the U.S. for most of the last decade , a distinction that’s come with some of the worst traffic congestion . Still, in 2000 and 2014, Austinites turned down referenda aimed at boosting public transportation.
That changed on Nov. 3, when 58% of voters approved Project Connect, a $7.1 billion plan to add 27 new miles of rail service, an expanded all-electric bus system, and affordable housing along new routes.
