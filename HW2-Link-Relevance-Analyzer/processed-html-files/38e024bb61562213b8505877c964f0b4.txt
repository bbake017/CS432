​WASHINGTON – President Donald Trump insisted Saturday that the election was "far from over" and his attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said the president would not concede the race, claiming without evidence that hundreds of thousands of ballots are in question.
"Obviously he’s not going to concede when at least 600,000 ballots are in question," Giuliani said during a press conference in Philadelphia shortly after the Associated Press and others projected that Democrat Joe Biden had won.
Trump and his attorneys have already demanded a recount in Wisconsin and are likely to request them elsewhere. They have also filed litigation in several states, though legal experts so far have said they do not see a legal path to reelection for Trump. Neither Giuliani nor Trump have offered evidence to substantiate their claims of fraud.
“We all know why Joe Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner, and why his media allies are trying so hard to help him: they don’t want the truth to be exposed," Trump said in a statement after the race was called. "The simple fact is this election is far from over."
Trump also vowed to pursue his claims in the courts, although many experts have said it is far from clear that the president has any viable legal strategy to challenge the outcome, given the size of Biden's lead in the pivotal "blue wall" states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.
Trump falsely accused Biden's campaign of urging the counting of "fraudulent" or "manufactured" ballots and those cast by dead people.
“So what is Biden hiding? I will not rest until the American People have the honest vote count they deserve and that Democracy demands.”
