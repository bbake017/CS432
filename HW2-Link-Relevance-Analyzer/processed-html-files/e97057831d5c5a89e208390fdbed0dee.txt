Donald Trump said he would “bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding”, or simulated drowning, at the Republican debate in Manchester, New Hampshire , on Saturday.
His Republican rival Ted Cruz , asked whether the practice notoriously used under the Bush administration during the war on terror was torture, denied it was: “Under the definition of torture, no, it’s not. It is enhanced interrogation ... It does not meet the generally recognized definition of torture.”
But the Texas senator added: “I would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use. And indeed I’d join with Senator [John] McCain in prohibiting line officers from employing it.”
Former Florida governor Jeb Bush – brother of former president George W Bush, under whom waterboarding was used by the CIA – said: “It was used sparingly, Congress has changed the laws and I think where we stand is the appropriate place.”
Meanwhile, Marco Rubio said it was inappropriate to discuss interrogation techniques.
The Republican candidates were debating on ABC ahead of the primary on Tuesday. Trump has a strong lead in the polls, although he lost last week’s Iowa caucuses to Cruz.
