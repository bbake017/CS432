Laura Zaccaria never studied anything related to coding.

Her husband started to dabble with vibe coding. He replicated her not-for-profit yoga organization website and sent her the link. He was like, "See what you can do now in a couple of hours?" She was quite intrigued.

He was going to sign up for a class called Code with AI in June. He asked her, "Why don't you come with me?"

Zaccaria supposes what he was trying to do was nudge her into exploring something else. Becoming a mother was a very life-altering experience — suddenly, her baby became the center of her world.

She went along with him. It's a capsule of time before going back to work, and in a career, you rarely get that, Zaccaria says.
